# Master-Project-To-Do-List
Take data from various Excel sheets and load into calendar style format listing review name and task due under the appropriate day/month. 

## What the Project Does
This program is built to pull standard formatted project plans built in Excel into Python and create a calendar base to-do list. This allows the User to view each day to determine all tasks due that day regardless what project plan it is from.
- Pull Excel Sheets Using Panda
- Extract data needed from imported data
- Format it into Calendar format by due date

## Why the Project is Useful
This elements the User from creating their own manual To-Do list with all Project tasks listing.  This will save the User time which could be used on more important elements of their Project.
